  // This is the My watchlist dummy page. It is intended to display items 
  // that a buyer has added to their watchlist. This page will be similar 
  // to browse.php but without a search bar. Once browse.php is integrated 
  // with a database, this page can be further developed.
  // Consider moving any reusable functions from browse.php to the shared 
  // "utilities.php" for use across multiple files.
